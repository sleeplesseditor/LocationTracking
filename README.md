# LocationTracking

An experiment in real time location tracking with React Native and React Native Maps. The app uses the Haversine formula to calculate the distance with longitude and latitude, and traces a line depicting the route taken by the user. The app uses the Google Maps API for both iOS and Android platforms.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
